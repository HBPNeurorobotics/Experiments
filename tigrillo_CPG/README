As a reminder
-------------

The file ExDTigrillo.exc is the main experiment file. It defines the experiment context (name, description, thumbnail, models, 3D config, ...)

The file Tigrillo.bibi is the Model file and includes:
  - A python brain models (that can be found in $HBP/Models)
  - The 3D model (a .sdf file) that should be contained in $HOME/.gazebo/models as well as in $HBP/Models and whose assets must also be in $HBP/gzweb/http/client/assets to display it in the browser.
  - Transfer functions written directly contained in python scripts included in the folder. They can also be used for monitoring some values during the simulation (recording, saving, displaying, ...)
