This folder contains the schema files for the adapted version of SCXML for the Human Brain Project.

The W3C proposed recommendation and the original schema files can be found at the following
locations:
  - http://www.w3.org/TR/scxml/ (Specification of Proposed Recommendation)
  - http://www.w3.org/2011/04/SCXML/scxml.xsd (Root Schema File)

While the original SCXML schema defines the namespace
    http://www.w3.org/2005/07/scxml
the HBP adaption uses
    http://schemas.humanbrainproject.eu/SP10/2015/ExDConfig/scxml

Currently the adaptions are limited to introducing an additional type "EventMapper" which allows
to formally specify mappings between SCXML events (internal and external events in
accordance with the specification) and external system events that trigger SCXML events. A mapping
is active as long as the state that declares it is active. Therefore, the 'EventMapper' extends the
SCXML 'invoke' directive.
In order to allow for event mappings for the entire runtime of the state machine the 'SCXML' type
was adapted to allow 'invoke' directives on the root level (semantics: "the invoked service is
active during the entire runtime of the state machine")

The 'scxml-ros-extensions' schema describes the concrete extension of the SCXML specification with
ROS specific directives. Amongst others, it specifies a EventMapper type to describe mappings
between incoming messages on ROS topics and subsequently raised SCXML events.

The introduced ROS specific types are:
- MessageOnROSTopic (extension of EventMapper and Invoke): Specified mapping between incoming
messages and subsequently raised events.
- Message (extension of SCXML Send): Specifies the sending of a particular message on a ROS topic
- ServiceRequest (extension of SCXML Send): Specifies the invokation of a ROS service.
